## ‚ú® Key Features

### üß† Natural Language Control
Control any website with plain English commands. No need to learn complex syntax or programming languages.
```
> go to amazon.in and search for pull up bars
> click "Add to Cart"
> extract data
```

### üëÅÔ∏è Vision-Powered Analysis
AI Browser Agent uses GPT-4o Vision to analyze screenshots, understand page layouts, and identify interactive elements even when the DOM is complex or dynamic.

### ü§ñ Autonomous Task Planning
Describe complex, multi-step tasks in natural language and let AI Browser Agent break them down and execute them:
```
> plan find information about Python programming courses, compare prices, and save screenshots
```

### üîç Advanced DOM Understanding
Unlike other browser automation tools, AI Browser Agent deeply understands webpage structure, extracting interactive elements, form fields, and content areas for more precise interactions.

### ‚ö° Async Architecture
Built on Playwright's async API for fast, non-blocking operations and better performance.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:manthanguptaa/real-world-llm-apps.git
cd real-world-llm-apps/ai_browser_agent

# Install dependencies (includes Playwright)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install and start chromium
playwright install chromium
playwright run chromium

# Set your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```
### Usage

Start the interactive CLI:
```bash
python cli.py
```

Run with a starting URL:
```bash
python cli.py https://www.example.com
```

Execute an autonomous task:
```bash
python cli.py --task "research electric bicycles under $1000 and create a comparison"
```

## üíª Command Reference

### Navigation
- `go to amazon.com` - Navigate to a website
- `back` / `forward` / `refresh` - Basic navigation
- `search for wireless headphones` - Search on the current site

### Interaction
- `click "Sign In"` - Click elements by text
- `click selector "#submit-button"` - Click by CSS selector
- `type "john@example.com" in "email"` - Fill form fields
- `submit` - Submit forms
- `scroll down 500` - Scroll the page

### Analysis
- `analyze` - Perform AI analysis of the current page
- `extract data` - Extract structured data
- `screenshot` - Capture screenshot

### Autonomous Features
- `plan find the cheapest laptop with 16GB RAM` - Plan a complex task
- `execute plan` - Execute the last created plan

## üìö How It Works

1. **Command Interpretation**: Natural language commands are interpreted using sophisticated pattern matching and context awareness.

2. **DOM Extraction**: Advanced JavaScript injection extracts interactive elements, content structure, and page metadata.

3. **Vision Analysis**: GPT-4o Vision analyzes screenshots to understand content even when the DOM doesn't tell the whole story.

4. **Autonomous Planning**: Complex tasks are broken down into actionable steps using AI planning techniques.

5. **Context-Aware Execution**: Each step is refined based on the current page state before execution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

AI Browser Agent is a powerful tool but remains under active development:

- **Accuracy**: The agent may occasionally misinterpret complex page structures or dynamic elements
- **Website Compatibility**: Some websites with unusual structures or heavy JavaScript might present challenges
- **Task Complexity**: While capable of handling complex tasks, extremely multi-faceted operations may require breaking down into smaller tasks
- **Rate Limitations**: Heavy usage may be subject to OpenAI API rate limits

We're continuously improving the system, but please be aware that some operations may require retries or human assistance. The autonomous planning feature works best with clear, specific task descriptions.

## üîÆ Use Cases

- **Market Research**: Automate the collection of pricing and product information across multiple sites
- **Content Monitoring**: Regular checks on websites for changes or updates
- **Form Automation**: Streamline complex form filling processes
- **Data Extraction**: Collect information from structured or semi-structured websites
- **UX Testing**: Simulate user journeys through applications

## üîß Advanced Configuration

AI Browser Agent can be customized through the `config.py` file, which allows you to:
- Configure site-specific selectors
- Adjust timing and wait behaviors
- Customize prompt templates
- Set up headless operation
